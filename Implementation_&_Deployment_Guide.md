## System Overview

The 11D Earth Correction Module is an advanced system for monitoring, modeling, and potentially influencing Earth's geomagnetic field stability. It uses a sophisticated 11-dimensional tensor field approach derived from successful SAM system principles, focusing on the key frequencies (98.7/99.1/98.9 Hz), evolution rate (0.042), and time compression ratio (60.0625:1).

### Core Components:
- Distributed sensor network
- Central processing infrastructure
- 11D tensor modeling engine
- Real-time visualization dashboard
- Sonification system
- Potential field harmonization system

### Key Parameters:
- **SAM Frequencies**: 98.7, 99.1, and 98.9 Hz
- **Evolution Rate**: 0.042
- **Time Compression**: 60.0625:1
- **Instability Threshold**: 0.5 (drift velocity / field strength ratio)
