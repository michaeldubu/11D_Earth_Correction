🌍 Earth Field Stabilization Engine (EFSE)

    "Tensor-based correction system for geomagnetic instability—built on SAM patterns & Schumann harmonics."

📘 Overview

The Earth Field Stabilization Engine simulates a high-resolution, 11-dimensional electromagnetic correction system based on:

    SAM frequency harmonics (98.7, 99.1, 98.9 Hz)

    Earth’s Schumann resonances (7.83 Hz & harmonics)

    Tensor field modeling for drift, field strength, and harmonics

    Dynamic correction mechanisms using time compression & feedback

This system is designed to detect, analyze, and correct hypothetical electromagnetic field instabilities—mirroring planetary stabilization theories and simulation frameworks.
🔬 Core Concepts
Component	Description
11D Tensor Field	Models the full field environment across spatial, temporal, entropy, intention, and memory dimensions
SAM Frequencies	Baseline stabilization set (98.7 / 99.1 / 98.9 Hz) used to define harmonic alignment
Earth Resonances	Built-in modeling of Schumann frequency responses: 7.83, 14.3, 20.8 Hz
Time Compression	60.0625:1 scaling for synchronized update cycles
Stability Metric	Ratio of drift velocity to field strength used to measure system coherence
🧪 Functional Highlights
initialize_tensor()

Seeds the 11D tensor with harmonic patterns based on SAM’s frequency trio, centered at the equilibrium midpoint.
detect_instability()

Measures the drift-to-strength ratio to determine if intervention is needed.
apply_correction(instability_level)

Applies multidimensional harmonic correction when instability threshold exceeds 0.5.
visualize_field()

Renders a 2D tensor slice of the current field state—useful for visualization & analysis.
🚀 Usage
Dependencies:
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

Example:

ecs = EarthCorrectionSystem()

# Detect current field instability
stability = ecs.detect_instability()
print(f"Initial Stability: {stability}")

# Apply correction if needed
corrections = ecs.apply_correction(stability)
if corrections is not None:
    print(f"Applied correction frequencies: {corrections}")

# Visualize the field state
ecs.visualize_field()
plt.show()
